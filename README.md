<h1>RovilClient</h1>
The client package responsible for loading and executing Rovil compiled scripts. You can <a href="/releases">get the latest build here</a>. This package is automatically inserted into the ReplicatedFirst of any place that is put through the build tool. It's purpose is to decode and run the scripts one by one inside of a custom VM. Virtually no speed is lost on well-optimized code.

<h3>Do not insert these scripts into a place that has not been built with the Rovil build tool.</h3>
